An evaporative cooler (also known as swamp cooler, desert cooler and wet air cooler) is a device 
that cools air through the evaporation of water. Sometimes noisy too due to the spinning motor and loose fittings.

To make it temperature controlled one temperature sensor is kept in front of the window of the cooler which will sense
the current room temperature and is used for switching on/off for the cooler. The temperature range is between 24 to 30 taken as
optimal temperature which is given by the user.All setup is connected to Raspberry Pi.

Also an 8X8 LED Matrix is attached to monitor the current room temperature.


System flow-

1- When the python code is executed on the terminal it will first display the current room temperature in degree C and 
   ask the user to enter the desirable temperature to be maintained for the room in the range >=24 and <=30.

2- If the temp given is out of the range it will display the message "Wrong Input" and will ask the user again to provide the
   input again.
   
3- If the user input temperature is within the range then it will display the message "Good to go" and keep on checking the 
   current room temperature against the user given temperature.
   
Use case-
   
    1- if the current room temperature is 26 C and the user input is 28 C the cooler will be in on state till it reaches the user
       given temperature.
      
    2- if the current room temp is 28 C and the user input is also 28 C the cooler will run till it reaches the 28-2 C temp
      which is 26 C. This is because the temperature sensor is very sensitive and to maintain the user given temperature
      it has to run at least for 2 C less.
      
    3- if the current room temperature is 28 and the user input is 26 the cooler will be in off state.
